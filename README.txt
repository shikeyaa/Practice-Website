- **Story:** Pulls all NBA game information to display in a list on the main screen.
- **Market:** Ages 4+
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often as needed during the NBA season.
- **Scope:** First, we are displaying live game updates along with the television networks for televised games.  Eventually the app could evolve to displaying team and player stats from a user search.
